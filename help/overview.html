		<h4> Setting layers and fields</h4>
			<p>Before using the following will need specifying Layers:set layers.</p>
			<p>Layer 1, and field to display/add to csv</p>

			<ul>
			<li>The drop down and arrows.</li>
			<li>Selecting a feature on the layer and clicking 'From Layer'</li>

		<h4> Adding features:</h4>
			<p>Features can be added through:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>1st column: Field of layer 1. Same name as field.</li>
		<li>2nd column: list of join field for mapped features of Layer 2. Same name as field.</li>
